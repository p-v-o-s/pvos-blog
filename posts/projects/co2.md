# [PVOS CO2 Monitor -- REV F](/co2/f)

["Rev F" of the PVOS CO2 Monitor](/co2/f) is a simple, through-hole PCB design based around an ESP32-based WiFi+LoRa microcontroller (the Heltec Wifi LoRa 32 v2) and the Sensirion SCD30 CO2 sensor.  Optional add-on includes a BMP388 for high-precision ambient pressure compensation, and a MAX466 electret microphone that uses ambient sound levels to assess room activity level.   

For more information -- including an assembly guide, links to pre-assembled kits, and simple ways of getting CO2 data online, please click [here](/co/f).
