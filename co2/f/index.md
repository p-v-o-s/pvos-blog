The primary repository for hardware and firmware designs is on github [here](https://github.com/p-v-o-s/co2-monitor/tree/main/rev_f). Below, you'll find material on:
- [Hardware design]() -- including design files in KiCAD, and quick links to order PCBs from OSHPark or JLCPCB.
- [Firmware]() -- currently in Arduino. (Micropython coming soon!)
- [Getting Started]() -- how to start collecting CO2 data online -- currently for Bayou-CO2 (Adafruit.io and Thingspeak coming soon!)
