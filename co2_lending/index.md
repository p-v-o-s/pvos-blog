## CO2 Monitor Lending Library

### What is a tool lending library?

Lending libraries are a great way to share resources that are only needed for a short period of time -- not just books, but all sorts of things, including tools (e.g. chainsaws, sewing machines, scientific instruments).

Another advantage to maintaining a tool library is that often this allows groups to organize tool training, regular maintenance, and upgrading of the tools in the library.  Saws can be kept sharp; sewing machines can be kept in working order; air monitors can be calibrated. 

### CO2 Monitor Lending Libraries

CO2 monitoring has long been used for determining the effectiveness of indoor residential ventilation. Changes in indoor CO2 concentration can indicate whether air inside a room has 'refreshed' since its most recent occupants left, or whether there is sufficient space and/or ventilation inside a building that people are unlikely to spread airborne illness. Recently, [researchers](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.20191676v1.full.pdf) have been exploring CO2 monitoring as factor in the assessment of the relative risk of indoor transmission of [COVID-19]().   

CO2 monitors range in price, features, and accuracy. For most use cases, it is important to make sure a CO2 monitor is calibrated in order to ensure that decisions are being made based on accurate CO2 readings.
