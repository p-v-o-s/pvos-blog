## CO2 Monitor Lending Library

### What is a tool lending library?

Lending libraries are a great way to share resources that are only needed for a short period of time -- not just books, but all sorts of things, including tools (e.g. chainsaws, sewing machines, scientific instruments).

Another advantage to maintaining a tool library is that often this allows groups to organize tool training, regular maintenance, and upgrading of the tools in the library.  Saws can be kept sharp; sewing machines can be kept in working order; air monitors can be calibrated. 

### Why is CO2 Monitoring Useful?

CO2 monitoring has long been used for determining the effectiveness of indoor residential ventilation. Changes in indoor CO2 concentration can indicate whether air inside a room has 'refreshed' since its most recent occupants left, or whether there is sufficient space and/or ventilation inside a building that people are unlikely to spread airborne illness. Recently, [researchers](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.20191676v1.full.pdf) have been exploring CO2 monitoring as factor in the assessment of the relative risk of indoor transmission of [COVID-19](). In the case of airborne illness, there are a few very common questions that CO2 monitoring can help answer:

- How long should people wait for air in a space occupied by another 'pod' to 'turn over' before entering it? 
- How many people can occupy the same indoor space before it is too 'crowded'?
- What techniques (opening a window, modifying the ventilation system) are most effective at refreshing air within a space?  How much ventilation is needed (how many windows need to be opened) in a given space?


### Starting your own CO2 Monitor Lending Library

CO2 monitors range in price, features, and accuracy. For most use cases, it is important to make sure a CO2 monitor is calibrated in order to ensure that decisions are being made based on accurate CO2 readings.
